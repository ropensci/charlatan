`charlatan` makes fake data, inspired from and borrowing some code from Python's faker (https://github.com/joke2k/faker)

Make fake data for:

* person names
* jobs
* phone numbers
* colors: names, hex, rgb
* credit cards
* DOIs
* numbers in range and from distributions
* gene sequences
* geographic coordinates
* emails
* URIs, URLs, and their parts
* IP addresses
* more coming ...

Possible use cases for `charlatan`:

* Students in a classroom setting learning any task that needs a dataset.
* People doing simulations/modeling that need some fake data
* Generate fake dataset of users for a database before actual users exist
* Complete missing spots in a dataset
* Generate fake data to replace sensitive real data with before public release
* Create a random set of colors for visualization
* Generate random coordinates for a map
* Get a set of randomly generated DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) to
assign to fake scholarly artifacts
* Generate fake taxonomic names for a biological dataset
* Get a set of fake sequences to use to test code/software that uses
sequence data

Reasons to use `charlatan`:

* Light weight, few dependencies
* Relatively comprehensive types of data, and more being added
* Comprehensive set of languages supported, more being added
* Useful R features such as creating entire fake data.frame's

## Installation

cran version

x$color_name()
```

## locale support

```{r}
ch_job(locale = "fr_FR", n = 3)
ch_job(locale = "hr_HR", n = 3)
ch_job(locale = "uk_UA", n = 3)
ch_job(locale = "zh_TW", n = 3)
```

## generate a dataset

```{r}
ch_generate()
```

```{r}
ch_generate("job", "phone_number", n = 30)
```

## job

```{r}
ch_job()
```

```{r}
ch_job(10)
```

## credit cards

```{r}
ch_credit_card_provider()
ch_credit_card_provider(n = 4)
```

```{r}
ch_credit_card_number(n = 10)
```

```{r}
ch_credit_card_security_code()
ch_credit_card_security_code(10)
```

## Documentation

All providers have documentation available through the help functions.
All providers of the same locales, are linked together, and for every language
we have a generic page, for example```?`dutch-language` ```.

There are three vignettes, about contributing to this project, what {charlatan}
does and a more in depth vignette about creating realistic data.
