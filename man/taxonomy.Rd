\description{
Create fake taxonomic names
}
\section{Names}{

Names were taken from Theplantlist. 500 genera names and 500
epithets were chosen at random from the set of 10,000 names in the
dataset in the \code{taxize} package. Theplantlist is, as it says on the
tin, composed of plant names - so these fake names are derived from
plant names if that matters to you. These may generate names that match
those of real taxa, but may not as well.

\section{Taxonomic authority}{

Randomly, the taxonomic authority is in parentheses - which represents
that the given authority was not the original authority.
